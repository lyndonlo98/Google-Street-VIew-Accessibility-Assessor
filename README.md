# Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to highlight a possible solution to help the disabled community navigating a city. This solution is not practical as our data source is Google StreetView images and images can be years old. 

We hope for a crowdsourced future, where autonomous vehicles will enable a data souce that will always have up to date images.
